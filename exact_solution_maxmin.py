# exact_solution_maxmin.py

# Exact solution for the Robust Selection Problem with discrete uncertainty and using the max-min criterion.

# Description: There are n items with costs c[s,i]. Note that costs in the max-min variant become profits. For easier
# execution the variable name will remain costs in the code. The goal is to pick exactly p items such that the
# worst-case profit is maximized. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program using the
# epigraph-reformulation.
